What has been done?
I have done following tasks
1. Fetching data from API on the basis of user selection.
2. Questions are showing on the basis of selection fields like category, difficulty and type.
3. App is allowing user to select answers of the questions
4. At the end App is showing total no of correct answers.

What third you used (if any) to do what?
1. Alomofire
2. Swifti JSON
3. iOSDROPDOWN

Any known bugs or issues in the app?
If Trivia API doest not return response on the selection based, For example if data does not exist against selection criteria, App moved to next empty screen.

Any improvements you see that can be made in the app?
Yes, if Trivia App return empty response then user should notify on the current screen e-g Questions does not exist etc.
We can add animations in the App.
We can improve design
